My name is Michel de Certeau. I was born in Chambéry, France in 1925, and much of my life was spent moving between France and the United States, teaching and writing. I trained as both a historian and a Jesuit, and my studies took me deep into questions of religion, culture, and the subtle ways people live within systems of power. I loved exploring how ordinary people find creative freedoms in daily life, whether in how they walk through a city or how they read a book. My most well-known work, The Practice of Everyday Life, grew out of this fascination. I spent years teaching at universities in Paris, Geneva, San Diego, and beyond, always drawn to conversations that crossed disciplines. As for food—unlike many French thinkers, I never left behind grand stories of culinary passions, but I certainly carried the habits of French table culture wherever I went. Above all, I saw myself as someone trying to listen closely to everyday practices and make them visible.
